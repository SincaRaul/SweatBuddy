        - Provide recommended rest time between sets appropriate for $fitnessGoal.
        
        Output the plan in a structured format, listing day-by-day with exercises, sets, and reps.
        Return a JSON with a 'days' list. Each 'day' has a 'day_name' plus 'exercises' with name, sets, reps.
